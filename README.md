# Pac-Man Game

This project is a simple Pac-Man-style game. It involves Pac-Man navigating through a maze, collecting dots while avoiding ghosts. The project demonstrates fundamental C++ programming concepts, including file handling, arrays, and game mechanics such as collision detection and AI behavior.

## Features

- Pac-Man: Collect dots while navigating a 2D map.
- Ghosts: Two ghosts that track Pac-Man, attempting to catch him.
- Win/Loss Conditions: The game ends when Pac-Man collects all dots (win) or is caught by a ghost (loss).
- Randomized Ghost Movements: Ghosts either move randomly or towards Pac-Man if they have a clear sightline.
- Custom Map: The game map is read from a text file (map.txt), which defines the layout of walls, dots, and empty spaces.
